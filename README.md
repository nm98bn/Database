# Database
This project allows a user to enter data of customers for their company.
With this data the user is able to track which customers they have, how many,
their order Id's, and monetary amount of purchase history. I'm currently working on adding
a functioning GUI to the program so that the menu is displayed and allowing for more
features such as specific information on each customers order.
